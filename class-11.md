> SEO 

Search engine optimization (or SEO) is the practice of trying to help your site appear nearer the top of search engine results when people look for the topics
that your website covers.


At the heart of SEO is the idea ofworking out which terms people are likely to enter into a search engine to find your site and then using these terms in the right places on your site to increase the chances that search engines
will show a link to your site in their results.


In order to determine who comes first in the search results, search engines do not only look at what appears on your Site. 
They also consider how many sites link to you (and how relevant those Links are).


> SEO ARE SPLIT INTO TEO FIELDS :  

1. **On-Page Techniques**

On-page techniques are the methods you can use on your web pages to improve their
rating in search engines.


The main component of this is looking at keywords that people are likely to enter into a search engine if they wanted to find your site, and then including these in the text and HTML code for your site in order to help the search engines know that your site covers these topics.


Search engines rely very heavily on the text that is in your pages so it is important that the terms people are going to search for are in text. There are seven essential places where you want
your keywords to appear.

2. **Off-Page Techniques**

Getting other sites to link to you is just as important as on-page techniques. Search engines help how to rank your site by looking at the number of other sites that link to yours. They are particularly interested in sites whose content is related to yours. For example, if you were running a website that sold fish bait, then a link from a hairdresser is notlikely to be considered as relevant as one rom an angling community.


Search engines also look at the words between the opening `<a>` tag and closing `</a>` tag in the link. If the text in the link contains keywords (rather than just click here or your website address) it may be considered
more relevant.

> How To Identify the Best Keywords for Your Website :

The words, images and product names your website includes can help improve your search engine ranking, increasing the chances that those who are interested in the types of products and services you offer can find your business online.

But how do you know what terms people use to search–and how do you incorporate them into your website in a way that works for your business?

Here’s a step by step guide to identifying the best keywords for your website.

What’s your business about? To identify which keywords are most relevant for your business, start by giving some thought to what it’s about, what it offers—and why customers need or want it. Brainstorm these questions, and write down anything that comes to mind: What do you sell? Why do people need or use it? Is your target audience limited to a specific location (if so, what cities/states/areas)? What kinds of questions do customers frequently have about your business or its products?

Try to come with a list of about ten words and phrases—even if they’re similar. Going back to the cleaning business example, your list might include terms like “house cleaning companies in Portland,” “affordable cleaning service in Portland,” “cleaning companies for landlords,” etc. The list will serve as the brainstorming tool you can rely on to generate keyword ideas; great creative!

What terms do the people you want to reach use? The list of terms you’ve brainstormed may be relevant to what your business does—but how well do the terms you think people use to find your business match up to the data Google has about their search activity?

Google AdWord’s Keyword Planner is a fantastic (and free) tool that helps you easily identify which search terms you may be able to incorporate into your website to help drive more traffic to it. Perhaps even more importantly, it helps you assess which terms are most likely to work to your advantage, based on the competitive landscape.

Start by creating a Google AdWords account (you are not obligated to purchase paid advertising to use the Keyword Planner tool). Once you’re signed in, input your product or service category, your website and your product category.

From there, select “Get Ideas” to see a list of suggested list of phrases and words that Google’s data indicates people use to search for products or services like yours. (You can fine tune the audience you’re trying to attract within the tool, too). Repeat the process using your brainstormed list of ten or so terms.

Where can you compete? Next to the suggested terms Google’s Keyword Planner provides, you’ll see a number (average monthly searches), competition rank (low, medium or high), and a suggested bid. If you don’t intend to buy ads, but simply want to focus on building online content that could help drive traffic to your site using relevant keywords, focus on the words/phrases that have a fairly high search volume, but are ranked “low” or “medium” in terms of competition. Because there are fewer competitors using paid advertising to attract customers who search using these terms, it’s more likely that the content you have on your site that incorporates these keywords will appear in search.

How can you say it? The current rules of content marketing with keywords requires a sensitive balance of incorporating important keywords, without looking like you’re trying. Try to use keywords naturally in headlines, content descriptions, headers, and towards the upper half of your post or article—but only to the extent that the keywords and phrases fit in a way that’s relevant and natural, based on the content.

Remember that the images you use to support written content and the image titles, tags, and file names play a role in your content efforts, too. Because images cannot be “read” by a search engine, the terms you use to name and organize them act as their identity.

FTP programs allow you to transfer files from your
local computer to your web server.

> Controlling sizes of images in CSS: 

You can control the size of an image using the width and height properties in CSS, just
like you can for any other box.


Specifying image sizes helps pages to load more smoothly because the HTML and CSS code will often load before the images, and telling the browser how much space to leave for an image allows it to render the rest
of the page without waiting for the image to download.


You might think that your site is likely to have images of all different sizes, but a lot of sites use the same sized image across many of their pages.


For example, an e-commerce site tends to show product photos at the same size. Or, if your site is designed on a grid, then you might have a selection of image sizes that are commonly used on
all pages, such as: Small portrait: 220 x 360 Small landscape: 330 x 210 Feature photo: 620 x 400 Whenever you use consistently sized images across a site, you can use CSS to control the dimensions of the
images, instead of putting the dimensions in the HTML.

> Examlpe on usage the code to style an image: 
```
img.large {
width: 500px;
height: 500px;}
img.medium {
width: 250px;
height: 250px;}
img.small {
width: 100px;
height: 100px;}
```

1. You can specify the dimensions of images using CSS.
2. This is very helpful when you use the same sized
images on several pages of your site.
3.  Images can be aligned both horizontally and vertically
using CSS.
4.  You can use a background image behind the box
created by any element on a page.
5.  Background images can appear just once or be
 repeated across the background of the box.
6.  You can create image rollover effects by moving the
background position of an image.
7.  To reduce the number of images your browser has to
load, you can create image sprites.
