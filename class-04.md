> **why we add links inside our pages?**

Links are the defining feature of the web because they allow you to move from one web page to another â€” enabling the very idea of browsing or surfing.

> **what are the typical way of crreating links?**

Links are created using the <a> element. Users can click on anything between the opening <a> tag and the closing </a> tag. You specify
which page you want to link to using the href attribute.

> **the importance of texts**

Many people navigate websites by scanning the text for links. Clear link text can help visitors find what they want. This will give them a more positive impression of your site and may
encourage them to visit it for longer. (It also helps people using screen reader software.)

To write good link text, you can think of words people might use when searching for the page that you are linking to. (For example, rather than write "places to stay" you could use
something more specific such as "hotels in New York.").

> ** Defintion: email link :**

mailto: email-links.html HTML To create a link that starts up the user's email program and addresses an email to a specified email address, you use the <a> element. However, this time the value of the href attribute starts
with mailto: and is followed by the email address you want the email to be sent to.

**for example**

```<a href="mailto:jon@example.org">Email Jon</a>```

> **Building Blocks**

CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its
own box. This box will either be a block-level
box or an inline box.

> **Containing Elements**

If one block-level element sits inside another
block-level element then the outer box is
known as the containing or parent element.

> **Function**

Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of st atements).nction

> **Declaring a function**

To create a function give it a name then write the statements neede to acheive its task inside curely braces.

> **Function Invocation**

The code inside the function will execute when "something" invokes (calls) the function:

When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button)
When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code
Automatically (self invoked)
You will learn a lot more about function invocation later in this tutorial.

> **Function Return**

When JavaScript reaches a return statement, the function will stop executing.

If the function was invoked from a statement, JavaScript will "return" to execute the code after the invoking statement.

Functions often compute a return value. The return value is "returned" back to the "caller":

**calling functions**

The call() method is a predefined JavaScript method.

It can be used to invoke (call) a method with an owner object as an argument (parameter).
